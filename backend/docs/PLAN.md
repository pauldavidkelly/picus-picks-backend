# Development Plan for Picus NFL Picks App

This document outlines our comprehensive approach to building the Picus NFL Picks application. We'll use an iterative development strategy, breaking down the work into manageable phases that build upon each other, much like constructing a house from the foundation up.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (1-2 days)

During this phase, we'll establish the basic project structure and essential tools. This is comparable to laying the foundation of a house - we need a solid base to support everything we'll build on top.

1. Backend Project Setup
   - Create new .NET Web API project with a clean, maintainable structure
   - Set up PostgreSQL database for reliable data storage
   - Configure Entity Framework for efficient database operations
   - Add basic Auth0 integration for secure authentication
   - Write initial database migrations to track schema changes
   - Set up testing infrastructure for code quality

2. Frontend Project Setup
   - Create new React project using modern best practices
   - Install and configure Tailwind CSS for efficient styling
   - Set up shadcn/ui components for consistent design
   - Configure Auth0 integration for seamless authentication
   - Set up testing infrastructure for reliable components

## Phase 2: Core Data Structure (2-3 days)

In this phase, we'll create the fundamental data structure our application needs. Think of this as framing the rooms in our house - we need well-organized spaces to store different types of information.

1. Create Basic Data Models
   - Users table for player information
   - Teams table for NFL team data
   - Games table for schedule and results
   - Picks table for user predictions
   - Leagues table for group organization

   - Write unit tests for data access patterns

## Phase 3: Authentication and User Management (2-3 days)

Now we'll implement security features. This is like installing locks and security systems in our house - we need to control access and protect user data.

1. Backend Auth Implementation
   - Complete Auth0 integration with proper security
   - Add user role management for admin functions
   - Create user profile endpoints for personalization
   - Write authentication tests for security

2. Frontend Auth Implementation
   - Add login/logout functionality with clear user feedback
   - Create protected routes for secure access
   - Add role-based access control for feature access
   - Test authentication flow thoroughly

## Phase 4: Game Management (3-4 days)

This phase focuses on NFL game data management. This is our core content management system - it's where we handle all game-related information.

1. ESPN API Integration
   - Create robust ESPN API service
   - Add efficient game data fetching
   - Implement smart data caching
   - Write comprehensive integration tests

2. Game Management Features
   - Create admin controls for game synchronization
   - Add game listing endpoints with proper filtering
   - Implement automatic game status updates
   - Test game management workflows

## Phase 5: Pick Management (3-4 days)

Here we'll implement the core pick-making functionality. This is the primary user interaction point of our application.

1. Backend Pick Features
   - Create secure pick submission endpoint
   - Add pick validation with deadline enforcement
   - Implement pick visibility rules for fair play
   - Write comprehensive tests for all scenarios

2. Frontend Pick Interface
   - Create intuitive pick submission form
   - Add clear pick visualization
   - Implement helpful deadline warnings
   - Test pick functionality thoroughly

## Phase 6: League Features (2-3 days)

This phase adds social and competitive features. It's where we create the community aspect of our application.

1. League Management
   - Create efficient league endpoints
   - Add accurate standings calculations
   - Implement engaging league statistics
   - Test league features thoroughly

2. Frontend League Interface
   - Add informative league dashboard
   - Create clear standings display
   - Show meaningful league statistics
   - Test all league components

## Phase 7: Dashboard and UI Polish (2-3 days)

In this phase, we'll refine the user experience and visual design. This is where we make the application both beautiful and functional.

1. Dashboard Implementation
   - Create personalized user dashboard
   - Add meaningful performance statistics
   - Implement helpful notifications
   - Test dashboard functionality

2. UI Refinement
   - Polish all visual components
   - Add informative loading states
   - Implement graceful error handling
   - Test responsive design thoroughly

## Phase 8: Testing and Documentation (2-3 days)

This phase ensures our application is reliable and maintainable. We'll verify everything works correctly and document how to use and maintain the system.

1. Testing
   - Complete comprehensive unit tests
   - Add integration tests for system flows
   - Create end-to-end tests for user journeys
   - Perform thorough user testing

2. Documentation
   - Update technical documentation
   - Create helpful user guide
   - Add clear API documentation
   - Document deployment process

## Phase 9: Deployment and User Feedback (2-3 days)

Finally, we'll set up our production environment and user feedback systems. This phase ensures our application is accessible and continuously improving based on user input.

1. Deployment Setup
   - Configure Render.com deployment for reliable hosting
   - Set up PostgreSQL database service
   - Configure environment variables securely
   - Implement automatic deployments from GitHub

2. Version Management
   - Implement semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Create version tracking system
   - Set up GitHub release workflow
   - Add version display in application

3. User Feedback System
   - Implement helpful feedback component
   - Create version check system
   - Set up notification system for updates
   - Configure GitHub Issues integration

## Version Management Strategy

We'll use semantic versioning to clearly communicate the impact of updates:

- MAJOR version (1.0.0): Significant changes affecting user interaction
- MINOR version (0.1.0): New features maintaining compatibility
- PATCH version (0.0.1): Bug fixes and minor improvements

## Deployment Strategy

Our deployment pipeline will maintain three environments:

1. Development Environment:
   - Automatic deployment from 'develop' branch
   - Used for testing new features
   - Contains latest development code

2. Staging Environment:
   - Automatic deployment from 'main' branch
   - Used for user acceptance testing
   - Contains stable pre-release code

3. Production Environment:
   - Manual deployment from GitHub releases
   - Used for live application
   - Contains thoroughly tested code

## Development Guidelines

Throughout all phases, we'll follow these principles for maintainable code:

1. Write Clear Methods
   - Keep methods focused and concise
   - Use descriptive names
   - Add helpful comments for complex logic

2. Maintain Clear Data Flow
   - Follow Controller → Service → Repository pattern
   - Keep models simple and focused
   - Implement clear validation rules

3. Ensure Quality Through Testing
   - Write tests for common scenarios first
   - Add edge case testing
   - Keep tests readable and meaningful

4. Document Continuously
   - Add XML comments to public methods
   - Keep README files current
   - Document important decisions

This comprehensive plan provides a clear path from initial setup through to deployment, with each phase building upon the previous ones to create a robust, user-friendly application.
