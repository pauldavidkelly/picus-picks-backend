# Test Fixes Specification

## User Story
As a developer, I want to fix failing tests in the PicusPicks.Web.Tests project to ensure our test suite is reliable and accurately verifies our application's behavior.

## Requirements
1. Fix authentication-related test failures in GamesServiceTests
2. Fix HTTP request verification issues in GamesServiceTests
3. Fix authentication scheme mismatches in AccountControllerTests
4. Ensure all tests pass without modifying the actual application behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All tests in PicusPicks.Web.Tests should pass
2. Test fixes should not require changes to the actual application code
3. Test fixes should maintain the original intent of each test
4. Documentation should be updated with lessons learned for future reference
