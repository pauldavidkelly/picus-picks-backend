# Test Fixes Implementation

## Overview
This document details the fixes implemented to resolve failing tests in the PicusPicks.Web.Tests project and captures key lessons learned for future reference.

## Changes Made

### GamesServiceTests Fixes

1. Authentication Token Mocking
   - Problem: Tests were failing due to attempting to mock the `GetTokenAsync` extension method
   - Solution: Replaced `GetTokenAsync` mocking with proper `AuthenticateAsync` mocking
   - Implementation:
     ```csharp
     _mockAuthService
         .Setup(x => x.AuthenticateAsync(It.IsAny<HttpContext>(), It.IsAny<string>()))
         .ReturnsAsync(AuthenticateResult.Success(new AuthenticationTicket(
             new ClaimsPrincipal(),
             authProperties,
             "Bearer")));
     ```

2. HTTP Request Verification
   - Problem: Tests were failing due to URL path comparison issues
   - Solution: Updated verification to handle full URLs correctly
   - Implementation:
     ```csharp
     req.RequestUri!.ToString() == $"http://test.com/{expectedPath.TrimStart('/')}"
     ```

### AccountControllerTests Fixes

1. Authentication Scheme Alignment
   - Problem: Tests were expecting "Auth0" scheme but code uses "OpenIdConnect"
   - Solution: Updated test expectations to match actual implementation
   - Implementation:
     ```csharp
     authServiceMock.Verify(
         auth => auth.ChallengeAsync(
             It.IsAny<HttpContext>(),
             "OpenIdConnect",
             It.Is<AuthenticationProperties>(p => 
                 p.RedirectUri == returnUrl)),
         Times.Once);
     ```

## Key Lessons Learned

### Moq Best Practices
1. **Extension Method Mocking**
   - Don't try to mock extension methods directly
   - Always mock the underlying interface method
   - Example: Mock `AuthenticateAsync` instead of `GetTokenAsync`

2. **HTTP Request Verification**
   - Be precise with URL matching
   - Consider the full URL, not just the path
   - Handle leading slashes consistently
   - Use `ToString()` for full URL comparison

3. **Authentication Testing**
   - Verify actual authentication schemes used in the application
   - Use proper authentication ticket setup
   - Consider token storage location in properties

### General Testing Tips
1. **Test Intent**
   - Keep the original intent of tests when fixing them
   - Don't change what's being tested, only how it's tested

2. **Debugging Approach**
   - Look at actual vs expected values in error messages
   - Check for subtle differences in strings (schemes, paths)
   - Use proper error messages in assertions

3. **Code Organization**
   - Keep helper methods for common setup
   - Use clear naming for test methods
   - Group related tests together

## Results
- All 16 tests now passing
- No changes required to application code
- Improved test reliability and maintainability
