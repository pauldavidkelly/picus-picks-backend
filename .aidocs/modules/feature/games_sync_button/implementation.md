## Games Sync Button Implementation

### Overview
The Games Sync Button feature has been implemented to allow users to manually trigger a sync of NFL games data from the external API. The implementation follows a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns between the service layer and UI components.

### Components Implemented

#### 1. GamesService
- Created `IGamesService` interface and `GamesService` implementation
- Implemented `SyncGamesAsync` method to call the API
- Added error handling and logging
- Location: `src/PicusPicks.Web/Services/GamesService.cs`

#### 2. GameDTO Model
- Created data transfer object to match API response
- Added all necessary properties for game data
- Location: `src/PicusPicks.Web/Models/GameDTO.cs`

#### 3. HTTP Client Configuration
- Added HTTP client registration in `Program.cs`
- Configured base URL with fallback to localhost
- Added as scoped service for dependency injection

#### 4. Games Page Updates
- Added Sync Games button with loading state
- Implemented error and success message handling
- Added responsive UI elements
- Location: `src/PicusPicks.Web/Components/Pages/Games.razor`

### Configuration
The API base URL can be configured in `appsettings.json` using the `ApiBaseUrl` key. If not specified, it defaults to `https://localhost:7071/`.

### Usage
1. Navigate to the Games page
2. Click the "Sync Games" button
3. Wait for the sync operation to complete
4. View success/error message

### Error Handling
- Service layer catches and logs exceptions
- UI displays user-friendly error messages
- Loading state prevents multiple simultaneous syncs
