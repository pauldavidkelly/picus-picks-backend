# League Table Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### Backend (API)
1. Enhanced `PickService.GetLeagueTableStatsAsync`:
   - Now calculates stats based on completed games and winning teams
   - Removed debug logging for cleaner production logs
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for various scenarios

### Frontend (Web)
1. Redesigned League Table component:
   - Modern card-based layout with color-coded performance indicators
   - Added trophy icon and gradient text for the header
   - Responsive design that adapts to screen sizes
   - Loading states and error handling

2. Fixed service configuration:
   - Removed BuildServiceProvider warning in Program.cs
   - Now properly using dependency injection for logging

## Testing
1. Added new unit tests for `GetLeagueTableStatsAsync`:
   - Tests for correct stats calculation
   - Edge cases for no completed games
   - Edge cases for no users

2. Existing frontend tests cover:
   - Component rendering
   - Data sorting
   - Empty states
   - Error handling

## Performance Considerations
- League table stats are calculated server-side
- Only completed games are considered in calculations
- Efficient database queries using Entity Framework Core

## Security
- All endpoints require authentication
- Using JWT tokens for API requests
- HTTPS enforced in production

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance in production
- Gather user feedback on the new design
- Consider adding more statistics (e.g., weekly/monthly trends)
